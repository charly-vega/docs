Submit a request to create a UGC-style video. Choose from 3 request formats:

- `video-from-url`: provide only a URL and we'll render a complete short video featuring the page's content.
- `video-from-text`: provide a text script together with optional content to feature in the final video.
- `video-from-spec`: most advanced, describe the entire video as a collection of scenes, with complete control over what actor to use, their voices, and other assets.
